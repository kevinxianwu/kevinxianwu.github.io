  abstract  = {Multilingual neural machine translation aimsat learning a single translation model for muliple  languages.  These  jointly  trained  mod-els often suffer from performance degradationon rich-resource language pairs. We attributethis degeneration to parameter interference. Inthis paper, we propose LaSS to jointly train asingle  unified  multilingual  MT  model.  LaSS learns Language Secific Sub-network (LaSS)for  each  language  pair  to  counter  parameterinterference.  Comprehensive  experiments  on IWSLT and WMT datasets with various Transformer  architectures  show  that  LaSS  obtainsgains on 36 language pairs by up to 1.2 BLEU.Besides, LaSS shows its strong generalization performance  at  easy  adaptation  to  new  lan-guage  pairs  and  zero-shot  translation.  LaSS boosts  zero-shot  translation  with  an  averageof  8.3  BLEU  on  30  language  pairs.},

  abstract  = {Automatic identification of mentioned entities in social media posts facilitates quick digestion of trending topics and popular opinions. Nonetheless, this remains a challenging task due to limited context and diverse name variations. In this paper, we study the problem of entity linking for Chinese news comments given mentionsâ€™ spans. We hypothesize that comments often refer to entities in the corresponding news article, as well as topics involving the entities. We therefore propose a novel model, XREF, that leverages attention mechanisms to (1) pinpoint relevant context within comments, and (2) detect supporting entities from the news article. To improve training, we make two contributions: (a) we propose a supervised attention loss in addition to the standard cross entropy, and (b) we develop a weakly supervised training scheme to utilize the large-scale unlabeled corpus. Two new datasets in entertainment and product domains are collected and annotated for experiments. Our proposed method outperforms previous methods on both datasets.},
